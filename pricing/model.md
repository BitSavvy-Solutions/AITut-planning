# AItutor Platform: Collaboration & Pricing Model

## Our Mission

AItutor is an open-source, not-for-profit project dedicated to building accessible and powerful AI tools for education. Our goal is to create a sustainable platform through community collaboration and transparent funding.

This document outlines our contribution-based pricing model, designed for partners like you who wish to use our platform for their courses.

## Our Pricing Philosophy: The Platform Contribution

To ensure the continued development, maintenance, and hosting of the AItutor platform, each subscription includes a modest, fixed **Platform Contribution**. This fee is not a profit margin; it is a direct reinvestment into the open-source development fund that benefits all users.

Our tiers are named to reflect the journey of our community members, from exploring the platform to championing its growth.

## Per-User Subscription Tiers

We offer several tiers to provide flexibility and value. All prices are shown in Canadian Dollars (CAD) and approximated in Swiss Francs (CHF).

| _Credit Breakdown:_ | | | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approx. Hosting & Data Cost | ~$1.50 CAD / `~0.86 CHF` | ~$1.50 CAD / `~0.86 CHF` | ~$1.50 CAD / `~0.86 CHF` |

**Why the Creator Plan Offers the Best Value:** As you can see, the Creator Plan provides significantly more AI credit for the same fixed $2 platform contribution. It is the most cost-effective option for active courses, minimizing the need for frequent top-ups and providing learners with ample resources.

## Credit Top-Up System

If a learner's credit balance runs low, they can easily top-up their account. Our top-up system is designed to be simple and transparent.

*   A fixed **$1.00 CAD / `~0.574 CHF`** Platform Contribution fee is applied to each individual top-up transaction to cover processing.
*   The remainder of the top-up amount is added directly to the learner's Usable Platform Credits balance.

**Example:** A `10.00 CHF` top-up would result in `~9 CHF` being added to the learner's credit balance.
