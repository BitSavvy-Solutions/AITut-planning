# Meeting Summary

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Frontend Updates
- Need to change website name from "Code Blossom" to "AITut" (subject to change)
- Discussion about localization implementation for frontend
- Current text is hardcoded, needs to be replaced with placeholder system
- Task created for frontend localization support

### 2. Backend Development Plans
- Will use Cosmos DB (Azure) for database
- Need to create two main database structures:
  - Course structure (modules, chapters, resources)
  - User profiles and progress tracking

### 3. Database Schema Requirements
- Course Structure:
  - Modules
  - Chapters in modules
  - Resources for each chapter
- User Profile:
  - Basic information
  - Email
  - Join date
  - Preferred language
  - Progress tracking
  - Completed/pending items
  - Current module status

### 4. Mentor-Student System
- Users can be both students and mentors
- Need to track:
  - Students assigned to mentors
  - Student progress for mentors
- Same user profile structure for both roles

### 5. Tasks Created
- Basic User Profile API implementation
- Cosmos DB integration for user profiles
- Backend development tasks broken down into smaller subtasks
- Initial task assigned to Desiree for environment setup

### 6. Future Considerations
- Question handling system
- AI integration
- Resource presentation (text vs video)
- Quiz implementation after chapters
- Course interface design needs wireframing

## Action Items
1. Desiree to work on basic backend setup
2. Need to create wireframes for course interface
3. Implement initial database schemas
4. Create basic API endpoints for user profiles
5. Set up Cosmos DB integration

## Timeline
- Initial backend tasks estimated at 2-4 hours each
- Development to be done in iterations
- No fixed timeline for complete implementation yet

## Notes
- Team agreed to keep tasks modular and assignable as needed
- Will continue to refine requirements as development progresses
- Need to maintain flexibility in design for future feature additions

## 📝 Note for Desiree
Hey Desiree! We've created some structured tasks for the backend development. These are just initial guidelines to help organize the work - feel free to approach them at your own pace and in whatever order makes sense to you. We can discuss and adjust these in our next meeting:

- [Basic User Profile API Creation](https://github.com/BitSavvy-Solutions/AITut-backend/issues/6)
- [Cosmos DB Integration](https://github.com/BitSavvy-Solutions/AITut-backend/issues/7)

No pressure on these tasks - they're there to help guide the development process, and we can adjust them based on your input and insights! 😊

## 🤝 Next Steps
- Team sync-up tomorrow to review frontend progress
- Continue backend infrastructure development
- Refine and adjust tasks based on team feedback

Keep up the great work, everyone! 🌟
