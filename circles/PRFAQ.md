# PR/FAQ: Circles - Collaborative Learning Groups for Aitut.iverse

## Press Release

**Iverse Introduces "Circles" - Transform Online Learning Through Small Group Collaboration**

*New feature enables students to form focused study groups, share progress, and learn together in a more personalized environment*

WORLDWIDE - Today, iverse announces Circles, a revolutionary new feature that brings the power of small group collaboration to online learning. Circles allows students to form intimate learning groups within courses, enabling them to share comments, track each other's progress, and support one another's learning journey - all while maintaining privacy and focus.

"Online learning often feels isolating, and course-wide discussions can become overwhelming with noise," said the AI-Tutor team. "Circles solves both problems by creating focused, collaborative spaces where learners can truly connect and help each other succeed."

Unlike traditional course forums where hundreds of students post in a single space, Circles creates small, intentional learning communities. Students can join multiple Circles for the same course - perhaps one with their local study group, another with colleagues from work, and a private "Connection" (two-person Circle) with a study buddy.

Key features include:
- **Private, focused discussions** - Comments and progress are only visible within your Circle
- **Multiple Circle membership** - Join different groups for different perspectives
- **Connections** - One-on-one study partnerships within the Circle framework
- **Circle administration** - Circle creators become admins who can invite members and assign moderators
- **Seamless course integration** - See all your Circles' discussions organized by course

"I was struggling with a React course until I joined a Circle with five other beginners," said beta tester Sarah Chen. "We helped each other through tough concepts, celebrated wins together, and actually completed the course - something I'd failed to do twice before on my own."

Circles is available immediately for all AI-Tutor users and can be accessed directly from any course page.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: What is a Circle?**
A: A Circle is a private learning group within a course where members can share comments, track progress, and collaborate. Think of it as your study group within the larger classroom.

**Q: How many Circles can I join for one course?**
A: You can join unlimited Circles for the same course. Many students find value in having different Circles for different purposes (e.g., a work colleagues Circle, a time-zone based Circle, and a Connection with a study partner).

**Q: What's the difference between a Circle and a Connection?**
A: A Connection is simply a Circle with exactly two people - perfect for one-on-one study partnerships, mentoring, or accountability buddies.

### Creating and Joining Circles

**Q: Who can create a Circle?**
A: Any user can create a Circle for any course they're enrolled in. The creator automatically becomes the Circle admin.

**Q: How do I join a Circle?**
A: Circles are invitation-only. You'll need an invite from the Circle admin or a moderator to join.

**Q: Is there a limit to Circle size?**
A: Currently, there's no hard limit, but we recommend keeping Circles under 15 members for optimal collaboration. Larger groups tend to recreate the problems Circles are designed to solve.

**Q: What happens when someone new joins our Circle?**
A: New members can see all previous discussions and progress shared within the Circle from the moment they join.

### Privacy and Visibility

**Q: Can I see discussions from Circles I'm not in?**
A: No. Circle discussions are completely private to members only. You can only see content from Circles you belong to.

**Q: If I'm in multiple Circles, how do I know which comments come from which Circle?**
A: When viewing course materials, comments are organized by Circle. Each Circle has its own discussion thread, clearly labeled with the Circle name.

**Q: Can I post the same comment to multiple Circles?**
A: Yes! When posting, you can select multiple Circles you belong to, and your comment will appear in each selected Circle's discussion.

### Managing Circles

**Q: What can a Circle admin do?**
A: Circle admins can:
- Invite new members
- Remove members
- Assign moderator roles
- Edit Circle name and description
- Archive the Circle

**Q: Can I leave a Circle?**
A: Yes, you can leave any Circle at any time. Your previous comments remain visible to other members, but you lose access to the Circle's content.

**Q: What happens to my comments if I leave a Circle?**
A: Your comments remain in the Circle for other members to see (maintaining discussion continuity), but your name appears as "[Former Member]" to indicate you're no longer active.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I switch between Circles while viewing a course?**
A: Each course page has a Circle selector that shows all your Circles for that course. Simply click to switch between them or view all Circles simultaneously in separate columns.

**Q: Will Circles affect my course progress tracking?**
A: No, your individual progress is tracked separately. However, you can choose to share your progress with your Circles to celebrate milestones and maintain accountability.

**Q: Can I create a Circle that spans multiple courses?**
A: Currently, Circles are course-specific. However, you can create separate Circles with the same members for different courses.

### Future Features

**Q: Will you add video chat or real-time collaboration?**
A: We're exploring real-time features like shared whiteboards and video study sessions for Phase 2, based on user feedback.

**Q: Can Circles have scheduled events or study sessions?**
A: Event calendars for Circles are on our roadmap, allowing members to schedule group study sessions and milestone celebrations.

**Q: Will there be Circle-level achievements or gamification?**
A: We're considering features like "Circle Streaks" and "Collaboration Badges" to recognize groups that actively support each other's learning.
