### **Detailed Role Definitions**

#### **Level 1: Novice Builder**
*   **Who they are:** An individual new to the professional tech environment. This could be a non-technical operations hire, a marketing associate helping with data entry, or someone in a dedicated learning-to-code role who is not yet contributing to the codebase. Their primary currency is curiosity and potential.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **Learning:** Actively absorbing project culture, tools, and processes.
    *   **Task Execution:** Handling well-defined, granular tasks (e.g., data cleaning, basic QA testing, content population) under direct supervision.
    *   **Support:** Providing support to the team on administrative or logistical tasks.
*   **Expectations:** To be proactive in learning, ask thoughtful questions, and demonstrate reliability in completing assigned tasks. They are not expected to make independent technical decisions.

#### **Level 2: Apprentice Builder**
*   **Who they are:** A student, intern, or junior hire who is actively developing technical skills. They are beginning to apply their knowledge in a practical, supportive environment under close guidance. They write code or configure systems, but their work is heavily reviewed.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **Guided Development:** Working on small, isolated bugs or very small features within a single component.
    *   **Skill Development:** Spending significant time pairing with Competent and Skilled Builders to learn best practices.
    *   **Tool Proficiency:** Learning to effectively use our core development and AI toolchain (e.g., GitHub Copilot, CI/CD, monitoring).
*   **Expectations:** To transition from theoretical knowledge to practical application. The goal is to graduate to becoming a independent contributor.

#### **Level 3: Competent Builder (~SDE I)**
*   **Who they are:** A full-time engineer who can operate independently on well-defined tasks within a single service or module. They are the foundation of our execution capability.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **Independent Execution:** Owning and delivering small-to-medium features from technical design to deployment with minimal guidance.
    *   **Code Quality:** Writing clean, tested, and maintainable code. Actively participating in code reviews.
    *   **Operational Excellence:** Responding to and resolving operational alerts for their owned services.
*   **Expectations:** To be a reliable, self-sufficient contributor on the team. They focus on "how" to build something correctly, given a clear "what."

#### **Level 4: Skilled Builder (~SDE II)**
*   **Who they are:** A seasoned engineer who owns a critical service or a large part of a system. They are a force multiplier for the team.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **Service Ownership:** Taking full ownership of a service's design, health, performance, and maintenance.
    *   **Mentorship:** Guiding Apprentice and Competent Builders, providing insightful code reviews, and improving team processes.
    *   **Design:** Designing and documenting significant components or microservices.
    *   **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Working with other Skilled Builders to define APIs and integration points.
*   **Expectations:** To move beyond just completing tasks to ensuring the long-term health and architecture of their domain. They begin to influence the "what" and "why," not just the "how."

#### **Level 5: Expert Builder (~SDE III)**
*   **Who they are:** A technical leader who owns a core business domain or a complex set of services. They are crucial for making high-quality, long-term technical decisions.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **Technical Strategy:** Defining the technical direction and architecture for a major product area.
    *   **Complex Problem Solving:** Architecting and leading the implementation of solutions to our most complex technical challenges.
    *   **Mentoring Leadership:** Mentoring Skilled Builders and ensuring high technical standards across multiple teams.
    *   **Business Alignment:** Translating complex business requirements into robust technical plans.
*   **Expectations:** To have a significant impact on the project's technical health and velocity. They are expected to be a source of truth for their domain.

#### **Level 6: Master Builder (~Principal SDE)**
*   **Who they are:** The project's top technical authority (e.g., CTO/CEO/CPO). They set the overarching technical vision and are ultimately responsible for the project's technical choices and their alignment with business goals.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   **project-Wide Vision:** Setting the long-term technical vision and strategy for the entire project.
    *   **Architectural Oversight:** Making final decisions on core technologies, architectural patterns, and platform choices.
    *   **Stakeholder Leadership:** Articulating the technical vision to investors, partners, and the entire project.
    *   **Cultivating Excellence:** Responsible for instilling a culture of high engineering standards, innovation, and craftsmanship from the top down.
*   **Expectations:** To ensure that the technology we build not only solves today's problems but also positions us to win in the market in the future. They are the ultimate owner of our technical debt and our technical future.
